# Network-and-System-Security-Project
The project was done in a group two people. In this project we presented a paper which was called Encryption Algorithm for TCP Session Hijacking. In this paper we also found calculation mistakes. Also we identified the limitations, things that were not specified and things that did not had any practical proof of concept.
